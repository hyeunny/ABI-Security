            <p>
              My name is Oat. Yes, like oatmeal. My real name is Nitsorn Wongsajjathiti.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am a junior front-end developer with an engineering degree from McGill.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have experience in computational analysis, colloid studies and other sciency things. So what? 
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to be your front-end developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have recently decided to pursue my passion of software development, after completing my chemical engineering degree from McGill University. I am deeply in love with this field and wish to work in a start-up where I can solve problems, and create solutions. <br><br>
              I think Axiom Zen is a great company powered with creativity and vision. Putting ideas into life is exactly what I want to do, and it seems you guys have already accomplished that with your past projects. I hope to be a part of AZ as a creative and technical input, and learn from fellow thinkers and builders; artisans and architects.

                <li><strong>I'm qualified    </strong>-I've had previous experience with front-end frameworks including AngularJS.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm a quick learner    </strong>    -I started my field transition from engineering to software 2 months ago. I am currently doing a start-up project and freelancing as a web developer. Give me time to learn, and I will give you results.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm passionate    </strong>    -While my introduction to coding is recent, I spend every waking moment working on building my skills. I enjoy logical interaction with computers and designing beautiful webapps.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm hardworking    </strong>    -You will not see anyone spending more time and dedication into making things 'juusst' right. </li>
                <li>
                Aside my engineering degree, I am a part-time graphic designer and an artist. I want to work at Axiom Zen. I will strive to be useful through my creative and technical input, and learn from senior developers and designers.
