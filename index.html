          <h2>A quick Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Oat. Yes, like oatmeal. My real name is Nitsorn Wongsajjathiti. I am a junior front-end developer with an engineering degree from McGill. I have experience in computational analysis, colloid studies and other sciency things. So what? 
            </p>
            <p id="shout">
              I want to be your front-end developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have recently decided to pursue my passion of software development, after completing my chemical engineering degree from McGill University. I am deeply in love with this field and wish to work in a start-up where I can solve problems, and create solutions. <br><br>
              I think the idea behind SimpleTax is incredible. During my years as an undergrad, I have spent countless hours struggling to understand the tax filing system as I applied for my tax returns. Line 150? Document T2022? What? 
              <br><br>
              Being able to take care of all this, and much more, SimpleTax is bound for a great success. I want to be a part of SimpleTax, and contribute to your team however I can. I may have a lot to learn, but I will get things done.

              <h2>Just 31 minutes</h2>
              <h4>Here is why you should give me a 31 minutes meeting to explain myself</h4>
                <li><strong>I'm qualified    </strong>-I've had previous experience with front-end frameworks including AngularJS.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm a quick learner    </strong>    -I started my field transition from engineering to software 2 months ago. I am currently doing a start-up project and freelancing as a web developer. Give me time to learn, and I will give you results.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm passionate    </strong>    -While my introduction to coding is recent, I spend every waking moment working on building my skills. I enjoy logical interaction with computers and designing beautiful webapps.</li>
                <li><strong>I'm hardworking    </strong>    -You will not see anyone spending more time and dedication into making things 'juusst' right. </li>
                <li>
                Aside my engineering degree, I am a part-time graphic designer and an artist. I want to work at SimpleTax. I will strive to be useful through my creative and technical input, and learn from senior developers and designers.
